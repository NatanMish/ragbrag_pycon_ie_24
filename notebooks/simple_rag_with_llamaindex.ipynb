      "Provide fair funding for climate. Scotland has over two thirds of the UK’s peatland, and currently plants over 60% of trees in the UK, yet funds restoration and planting within our budget, with no help from the UK Government. Westminster must ensure fair funding flows to devolved nations to enable our, and their, climate ambition given that for the whole of the UK to reach net zero by 2050, Scotland must do so  by 2045.\n",
      "Establish a Four Nations Climate Response Group to agree climate plans across the UK  that deliver on our net-zero targets and ensure  the UK Government stops backtracking on climate ambition.\n",
      "Devolve powers to create a bespoke migration system for Scotland that values those who decide to work, live, study and invest here and allows us to address our specific demographic and economic needs. Introduce a rural visa pilot scheme. Scotland should have full powers over immigration, including the devolution of overseas workers’ employment visas. Until then, it is vital the UK Government acknowledges the distinct demographic challenges we face in Scotland and introduce a pilot to mitigate against labour shortages as a result of a hard Brexit and hostile immigration policies.\n",
      "Mitigate the harm of Brexit on productivity  by reviewing immigration rules and expanding shortage occupation lists, so businesses have access to the workforce they need. Provide sustainable funding for farming.  Despite numerous requests, Scotland has had no commitment from Westminster on any future funding for farming after 2025. The UK  Government must increase funding for farming  – to at least pre-Brexit levels - and provide certainty through multi-annual funding frameworks. Agree a veterinary agreement with the EU to ease exports and imports.\n",

But we want to go further. Our commitment to tackling the twin crises of climate change and nature loss is unwavering and we believe emissions reduction and economic prosperity go hand in hand. We want  to share in the enormous economic opportunities of the global transition to net zero. SNP MPs will demand the UK Government:\n",
      "Bring forward an immediate emergency budget following the election to reverse cuts to public spending and deliver meaningful investment in economic growth, including green energy.\n",
      "Work at pace with the Acorn Project and Scottish Cluster to secure the fastest possible deployment following the UK Government’s failure to support the Acorn carbon capture, utilisation and storage project at track 1. Urgent clarity is required to restore investor confidence, boost economic opportunities and make progress against our net zero obligations. Modernise the Contracts for Difference scheme to enable the stable deployment  of Scotland’s renewable energy pipeline.\n",
      "Take an evidence-based approach to oil and gas.  The UK Government is the decision-maker on new oil and gas licences. We believe any further extraction must be consistent with  our climate obligations and take due account  of energy security considerations. Decisions must be made on a rigorously evidence-led, case-by-case basis, through a robust climate compatibility assessment.Support the North East and the Just Transition.  North Sea oil and gas is naturally declining,  and as the transition to new industries gathers pace, we are clear that the workers, families  and people of that industry and the North East must not be abandoned. We are supporting  them with the £500 million North-East Transition Fund - a fund the UK Government must now  at least match. Deliver a sustainable future for Grangemouth.\n",
