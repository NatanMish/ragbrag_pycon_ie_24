But we can only ever cut taxes responsibly when we have a way to fund it sustainably, consistent with getting debt and borrowing down and in a way which does not send inflation spiralling. Because of the support we provided to families and businesses through Covid and the energy shock, we had to make difficult decisions to pay down our debts.

Because of the decisions we had taken to boost domestic energy production and invest in renewables, Britain had little reliance on Russian fuel when the invasion began, unlike some of our European neighbours. But when global energy prices spiked, the Government stepped in to pay around half the typical household bill at the peak, saving families £1,500 on average. Bills are now coming down, and in July will fall to the lowest level in over two years. But the shock has reminded us of the importance of securing our long-term energy supply.\n",

We are proud of our investment in grassroots sports across the country, with over £320 million being delivered between 2021 and 2025 to build, renovate and maintain grass pitches and, multi-sport facilities. We will maintain this pace of investment over the next Parliament through the continuation of the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme. We will look to expand the criteria to ensure more sports benefit from this investment. We will introduce laws to ensure our fans never again face the threat of clubs in England joining breakaway closed-shop competitions and giving them more of a voice through the Independent Football Regulator.

In London, despite the high profile hiring of a ‘Night Czar’ by the Labour Mayor, over 3,000 pubs, bars and nightclubs have closed in the capital since March 2020. We will turn this around by launching a review of the nighttime economy in England, looking at how to reverse the decline in pubs and clubs and how to make our towns and cities great places to go out.

A moment where we can turn  the page on a set of ideas that,  over 14 years, have consistently left us more vulnerable in an increasingly volatile world. And an opportunity to begin  the work of national renewal.  A rebuilding of our country,  so that it once again serves  the interests of working people.

To outsiders  they may not seem exceptional  or distinctive, but they are essential for a sense of collective national purpose. Britain is no different,  but at this moment two of our  most important beliefs are in  grave danger. First, that politics should be driven by a sense of service to the  country, not considerations of  party or self-interest. Second, that if you work  hard then – whoever you are, wherever you started in life –  Britain is a country that will  respect your contribution and  give you a fair chance to get on.\n",

Then, as now, our economy was gripped by stuttering growth and  a cost-of-living crisis that hurt working people. Yet back then, there was at least  a degree of security in being able  to take those two fundamental beliefs for granted. For families like mine, this was a comfort. The knowledge that Britain would  offer your children a better future gave us hope. A hope that may not\n",

Stop the chaos  To restore this hope, we must first end the Conservative chaos. The visible decline in our communities – families weighed down by soaring mortgages; people waiting on trolleys in A&E; sewage in our rivers – is not an accident. Rather, it is a direct result of a governing party that, time and again, puts its own interests and obsessions above the issues that affect families.\n",

But also, because their failures have sapped our collective confidence that Britain can still achieve great things. I reject this with every fibre of my being. Despite all the chaos inflicted on Britain, the country I see is one where working people never let each other down.

The Conservatives’ ban on new onshore wind, failure to build new nuclear power stations, and decision to scrap investment in home insulation landed British families with amongst the highest energy bills in Europe.
